              Here are my reviews, summaries, takes, or opinion pieces on books, movies, tweets, or
              podcasts I have consumed. The contents here tend to be less tech-y, sometimes less
              clear and organized. And they might look self-serving as some of them are just notes I
              wrote to myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Essentially, here are posts I don&apos;t want or have the time to give a complete
              article treatment. That being said, hope you can find any of them valuable to you.
